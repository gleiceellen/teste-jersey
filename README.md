CRUD Rest JAX-RS/Jersey

* Java
* JAX-RS/Jersey
* H2 DB
* Build with Maven

That's what I got to do from the test. I've never worked with a Web service before and I had difficulties with the concept, I'm also used to working with Spring so what I did was what I did with Internet searches these two days. I believe that with more time I could deliver what was requested however I know it does not justify and if it is not enough I thank for the opportunity and hope to try again again being more prepared.
